# Hand Gesture Detection Package

The Hand Gesture Detection Package is a library for iOS that enables you to initialize an object capable of using your device's camera to detect a variety of hand gestures. It is built upon the concepts and techniques outlined in the [Apple tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/detecting_human_actions_in_a_live_video_feed) that focuses on detecting human actions in live video feeds, such as exercises. However, this package specifically extends the capability to recognize and classify hand gestures, making it a powerful tool for developing applications with gesture-based interactions.

## Features

- Detects a range of hand gestures, including:
  - üëä (Fist)
  - üëç (Thumbs Up)
  - ü§û (Crossed Fingers)
  - ‚úåÔ∏è (Peace Sign)
  - üëå (OK Sign)
  - üëã (Wave)
  - üñï (Middle Finger)

- Utilizes the device's camera to capture live video feed for real-time gesture detection.
- High-performance and accuracy, thanks to the underlying machine learning model.
- Easily integrated into your iOS applications, offering gesture-based interactions to enhance user experiences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can start using the Hand Gesture Detection Package, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Development environment for iOS app development set up.
- Familiarity with mobile app development using Swift.
- Access to the device's camera for video feed capture.

### Installation

1. **Install Package**: To use the Hand Gesture Detection Package in your Swift project, add it as a dependency using the Swift Package Manager. Add the following URL to your `Package.swift` file's `dependencies` array:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/wolfej94/gesture-recognizer-kit.git", from: "1.0.0"),
```

2. **Import Package**: In your code, import the package to make use of its gesture detection capabilities.

3. **Initialize Gesture Detection Object Using the ViewModel**: Create an instance of the gesture detection object within your SwiftUI view using the `ContentViewModel` provided. Configure it as needed within your SwiftUI view, and start capturing video feed for gesture detection.

   ```swift
     import SwiftUI
     import GestureRecognizerKit // Import the package
  
     class ContentViewModel: ObservableObject {
      
      // MARK: - Variables
      var videoProcessingChain: VideoProcessingChain
      var videoCapture: VideoCapture
      @Published var label: String = "Loading"
      
      // MARK: - Initializers
      init() {
          videoProcessingChain = VideoProcessingChain()
  
          // Begin receiving frames from the video capture.
          videoCapture = VideoCapture()
          videoProcessingChain.delegate = self
          videoCapture.delegate = self
      }
    }

    extension ContentViewModel: VideoProcessingChainDelegate {
      
      func videoProcessingChain(_ chain: GestureRecognizerKit.VideoProcessingChain, didPredict actionPrediction: GestureRecognizerKit.ActionPrediction, for frames: Int) {
          label = actionPrediction.label
      }
      
    }

    extension ContentViewModel: VideoCaptureDelegate {
        
        func videoCapture(_ videoCapture: GestureRecognizerKit.VideoCapture, didCreate framePublisher: GestureRecognizerKit.FramePublisher) {
            label = "Loading"
            videoProcessingChain.upstreamFramePublisher = framePublisher
        }
        
    }

   struct ContentView: View {
       @ObservedObject var viewModel = ContentViewModel() // Initialize the view model

       var body: some View {
           // Your SwiftUI view content here
           Text(viewModel.label)
               .onAppear {
                   // Configure and start gesture detection
                   viewModel.videoProcessingChain.delegate = viewModel
                   viewModel.videoCapture.delegate = viewModel
                   viewModel.videoCapture.startCapturing()
               }
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, we initialize the `ContentViewModel` within your SwiftUI view and configure the gesture detection components. Ensure that you have appropriate SwiftUI views to display the captured video feed and handle gesture events as desired.
